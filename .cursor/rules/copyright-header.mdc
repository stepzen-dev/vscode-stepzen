# Copyright and Attribution Header Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Every file that is created or modified by Cursor must include a copyright and attribution header at the top of the file.

## Required Header Format

### For TypeScript/JavaScript files (.ts, .js, .mjs):
```typescript
/**
 * Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
 * Assisted by CursorAI
 */
```

### For JSON files (.json):
```json
{
  "_copyright": "Copyright IBM Corp. 2025",
  "_attribution": "Assisted by CursorAI",
  // ... rest of JSON content
}
```

### For Markdown files (.md):
```markdown
<!--
Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
Assisted by CursorAI
-->

# Document Title

Document content goes here...

---

*Portions of the Content may be generated with the assistance of CursorAI*
```

**Note**: Markdown files require both:
1. **Copyright header** (HTML comment at the top)
2. **User-visible footer** at the end of the document

### For GraphQL files (.graphql):
```graphql
# Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
# Assisted by CursorAI
```

### For Configuration files (.mjs, .js config files):
```javascript
/**
 * Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
 * Assisted by CursorAI
 */
```

## Implementation Rules

1. **Always add the header** when creating new files
2. **Always add the header** when making substantial modifications to existing files
3. **Place the header at the very top** of the file, before any other content
4. **Use the exact text**: "Copyright IBM Corp. 2025" and "Assisted by CursorAI"
5. **Use appropriate comment syntax** for the file type
6. **Do not modify existing copyright headers** - add the new header above them if needed

## Examples

### New TypeScript file:
```typescript
/**
 * Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
 * Assisted by CursorAI
 */

import * as vscode from "vscode";
import { services } from "../services";

export function newFunction() {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Existing file being modified:
```typescript
/**
 * Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
 * Assisted by CursorAI
 */

// Existing file content continues here...
import * as vscode from "vscode";
```

### Test files:
```typescript
/**
 * Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
 * Assisted by CursorAI
 */

import * as assert from "assert";
import * as vscode from "vscode";

suite("Test Suite", () => {
  // Tests
});
```

### Markdown files:
```markdown
<!--
Copyright IBM Corp. 2025
Assisted by CursorAI
-->

```

## Special Cases

- **Package.json**: Add as JSON comments at the top
- **Configuration files**: Use JavaScript-style comments
- **Generated files**: Still include the header
- **Fixture files**: Include the header appropriate to the file type

## Enforcement

This rule applies to ALL file modifications, including:
- New file creation
- Existing file edits
- Refactoring changes
- Bug fixes
- Feature additions
- Test file modifications

**No exceptions** - every file touched by Cursor must have this header.
